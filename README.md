# spectralEIT

  

Simulate and analyse spectrum of the alkali metals: sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs).

  

## Installation

  

Installation is currently unavailable and you have to open the program by source code.

The easiest way:

- Download or clone the repository

- Inside the the repository create an environment with Anaconda or a virtual environment of your choice
